# 👋 Hey there, I'm Foo Phey Min

I’m a **Fullstack Developer** from **Malaysia**, passionate about building practical and visually appealing web applications.  

Before diving into software development, I worked as an **IT support technician and POS system trainer**, helping businesses digitalize their operations. That experience taught me how to communicate clearly with users and understand real-world business needs — lessons I carry into my coding journey today.
